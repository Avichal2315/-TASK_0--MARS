ABOUT Automatic Door hinge

When was sitting on my table thinking what to make for mars task 1 ,one of my friend came into my room to pass the time . After some time he went out. But when he didn't closed the door . 
And i was like "damn , now i have to get up and close the door" . Now as lazy as I am I thought why don't we have automatic doors which closes if no body is there at the door.
the i thought why not i make one in arduino . That's how I got the idea of automatic door hinge.
